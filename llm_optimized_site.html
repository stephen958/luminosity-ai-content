                        <p itemprop="text">
                            AI search optimization is the practice of improving how AI platforms and large language models discover, understand, and cite your business information when responding to user queries. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking in search results, AI optimization focuses on being accurately represented and cited in AI-generated responses.

                        <p itemprop="text">
                            With one in five searches now going through AI platforms and traditional search projected to decline by 50% within 24 months, businesses that are not optimized for AI visibility risk losing significant market presence. AI search represents a fundamental shift in how potential customers discover and evaluate businesses.

                        <p itemprop="text">
                            Traditional SEO focuses on ranking positions in search engine results pages (SERPs). AI optimization focuses on being accurately cited and recommended within AI-generated conversational responses. This requires different strategies including conversational content, structured data implementation, authority building through third-party citations, and creating machine-readable content formats.
